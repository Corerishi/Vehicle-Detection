# Vehicle-Detection

This project implements a vehicle detection and counting system using Python and OpenCV. The system reads a video, detects moving vehicles using background subtraction, tracks them, and counts how many vehicles cross a defined line in the video frame. It can be used for monitoring traffic flow or parking management.

Features
Detects and tracks moving vehicles in a video.
Counts vehicles that cross a predefined line.
Displays bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
Real-time vehicle counter displayed on the video feed.
Easily adjustable parameters for vehicle size detection and line positioning.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
